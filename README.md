I've developed a website that safeguards a secret message, requiring successful authentication for access. Following are the functions and features of this website.

1.  To enhance the user experience, I incorporated a dynamic background animation using vanilla JavaScript.
2.  Prior to signing in, the background animation displays a captivating black and green matrix effect.
3.  Once authenticated, the secret message "Artificial intelligence for IT Operations" is revealed to the authorized user as an animated background.
4.  To ensure a seamless transition, logging out triggers a colour transformation of the text, resembling the matrix animation with colour texts.
5.  This website doesn't rely on videos, After Effects, or other external animation tools; the entire animation is achieved purely through JavaScript coding. By leveraging vanilla JavaScript, I was able to create a dynamic and interactive website without the need for additional libraries or frameworks.
6.  Users are provided with a secure and immersive experience, as they navigate through the authentication process and discover the hidden secret.
